# DoctAid
#### *AI Empowered Healing*
DoctAid is an AI-powered healthcare platform providing instant diagnosis and teleconsultations, bridging gaps in healthcare access, especially for underserved communities.

## **Inspiration**

Access to healthcare is limited in remote areas, underserved communities, and for international students due to long wait times and high costs. **DoctAid** addresses this with AI-powered diagnosis and teleconsultations, reducing doctors' workload and offering accessible care.
